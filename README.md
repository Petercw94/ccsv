# csv-parser

*This repo is still under development.*

## TODO:
1. Update the get_headers function to return a dictionary instead of a tuple.
2. Add a filter method that will take in an index or a header and a search pattern and will search the 
specified column for that pattern. Return a tuple of rows found that match the provided pattern.
